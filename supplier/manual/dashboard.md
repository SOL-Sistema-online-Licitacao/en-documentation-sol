On this home screen, you will see an overview of your profile: your personal information and the latest open bids - those that you are participating in or that you can participate in.

{% hint style="success" %}
For each displayed bid, we have access to the latest ten open bids and can view the key information about the documents. These are:

* The title of the bid;
* Its current status;
* The period of time it will remain open.

To view all bids, in addition to the latest ones, simply click on the Browse bids button.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, you have access to your profile and System notifications - represented by the person and bell icons, respectively.
