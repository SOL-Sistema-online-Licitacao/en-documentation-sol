# Remove proposal

### How to remove a submitted proposal?

You can remove a submitted proposal as long as the bid that received it is still open. To do so, just access the bid in question and go to the "Lots and items" tab. So, just click on the lot whose proposal you want to remove and then click on Remove proposal.
