# Proposal accepted/rejected

{% hint style="success" %}
### Proposal accepted

If your proposal is accepted by the Association and approved by the Reviewer, you will receive notification. The System generates a contract that is sent to the winning Supplier. At this step, you can either sign the contract or decline it. To make this decision, it is important to pay attention to the items, quantities and deadlines specified in the document.

### Rejected Proposal

If the Association chooses a proposal from another Supplier, the only notification you will receive is one indicating the end of the bidding. By clicking on the notification, it is possible to access the bidding page. In it, clicking on the "Lots and items" tab, then on one of the displayed lots and, finally, on "View all proposals" or "View lot proposal", you can see the list with all the proposals – including yours – with an indication of which was the winner.

### Draw

If your bid for a particular tender is identical in value to another Supplier's bid, you will receive a notification informing you of the deadline for you to update your bid, if you wish. This date is defined by the Association when creating the bid.

&#x20;If you want to reduce the value of the proposal to continue disputing the bid, just click on the notification or access the bid through the "Bids" page, available in the main menu.
