# Update proposal

### How do I update a submitted proposal?

{% hint style="info" %}
It is only possible to edit the proposal if the bidding is not of the "Closed Invitation" mode.
{% endhint %}

The Supplier can update the values of the proposals - made by him - while the bidding is still open. To do so, just access the bid in question and go to the "Lots and items" tab. So, just click on the lot whose proposal you want to update and then click on Edit proposal.

Once done, enter the new value of the proposal and click on Save proposal. At the same time, it is possible to update the freight value.
