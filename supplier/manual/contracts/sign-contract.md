# Sign contract

### How to sign a contract?

{% hint style="info" %}
It is only possible to sign contracts if the status of the contract is "Waiting for signature".
{% endhint %}

To check the contract details or sign it, click on it. The page that will be displayed contains two parts. In the first, the Supplier will be able to check information such as the name of the Association and value, and can accept or reject the contract. The second part, when clicking on Proposal, works as a link to the bid that gave rise to the contract and to the proposal sent by the Supplier.&#x20;

If the Supplier has no problem regarding the quantities and deadlines required in the contract, he must click on Accept. With this, you will be digitally signing the contract.

When you click Accept on the page displayed above, the System will ask you to confirm the action. The contract status will be updated to "Signed".

### Refuse contract

If you need to refuse a contract, just access its page through the System's main menu and then click on Decline and confirm this action on the screen that appears next.&#x20;

With this action, the contract is deleted from your list of contracts and the flow ends.
