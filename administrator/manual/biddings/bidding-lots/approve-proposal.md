# Approve proposal

If there is no problem with the Association's choice, simply click on Approve proposal. After this step, the Association and the selected Supplier will continue with the bidding and contract process.

As a result, the status of the bidding changes to "Released". The System will automatically start it on the date defined by the Association, and then suppliers can submit their proposals.
