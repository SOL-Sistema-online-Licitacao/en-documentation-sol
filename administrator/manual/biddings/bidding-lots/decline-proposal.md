# Decline proposal

If you identify any irregularity in the Association's choice, you should click on Disapprove proposal.

The system will display a dialog box asking you to justify the disapproval. Simply write the reason in the indicated field and click on Disapprove proposal again.

As a result, the bidding returns to the "Draft" situation, a phase in which only the Association can view or modify it. It is up to the Association to make the necessary changes and submit the bidding again for analysis and approval.
