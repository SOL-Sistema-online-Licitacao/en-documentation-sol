# Update group

### Como editar um grupo?

To edit information for a registered group of items, simply click on the edit icon (pencil) available next to the group name in the list on the "Agreement Data" page.

To remove an item from the group, simply click on the delete icon (red X), located next to the estimated cost of the item. Repeat this operation as many times as necessary to remove as many items as desired.

To add new items, simply type the first three letters of the item in question in the "Cost Item" field, and the system will display a list of all items containing those letters.

Then, select the desired item, specify quantity, estimated cost, and click Add. Repeat this operation as many times as necessary to complete your new group of items.
