# Add group

### How to add a new group?

To add a new group to the Work Plan, just click on the New Item Group button, then fill in all the requested data.

Each group can contain several items. To add them, just type the first three letters of the item in question in the "Cost Item" field and the System will show a list with all the items that contain those letters.

Then, simply select the desired item, specify the quantity, estimated cost, and click Add. Repeat this operation as many times as necessary to complete your new item group.
