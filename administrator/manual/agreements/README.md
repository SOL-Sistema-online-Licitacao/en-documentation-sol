# Agreements

In the "Agreements" tab, accessible through the main menu at the top of the page, you can see a list of all agreements registered in the system, view details about them, edit information, delete an agreement, or add a new one.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's worth noting that if the agreement data has been imported from an integration, it is not possible to edit them, regardless of the administrator's profile.
