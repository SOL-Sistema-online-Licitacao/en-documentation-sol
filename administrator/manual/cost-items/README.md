# Cost items

In the "Cost Items" tab, accessible through the main menu at the top of the page, you can see a list with all the cost items registered in the system, view details about them, edit the information, delete an item, or add a new item.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is worth noting that if the cost item data has been imported from an integration, it is not possible to edit them, regardless of your administrator profile.
{% endhint %}

### How to view item details?

By clicking on one of the items, you have access to the page with the general data, including which segment and category it belongs to.
