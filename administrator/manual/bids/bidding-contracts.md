# bidding contracts

Clicking on the Contracts button of the bidding allows you to access the contracts generated from it, with information such as value and which Supplier won the bidding. The contract will only be available in completed biddings, as it is generated only after the bidding is closed and a proposal is chosen.

In the case of a completed bidding, for which the System has already generated a contract to be signed by the Association and the Supplier, the Reviewer can click on the contract to see more details about it. Also in this case, the Reviewer can only check data, with no possible actions.
