### How to view a bid details?

To access complete information about a bid, simply click on the Detail button available in the bid's panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Administrator has permission to perform actions such as releasing the bid and approving or rejecting the choice between proposals made by the Association. As a rule, the Administrator does not perform any of these actions, as they are functions of the Reviewer that he designates for each agreement. Therefore, throughout all items related to bids, this manual will refer to the Reviewer profile.
