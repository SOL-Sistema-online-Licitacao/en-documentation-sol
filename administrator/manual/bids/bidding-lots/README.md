# Bidding lots

To check which items are being bid on and in what quantity, just click on Bidding Lots. A page with the information is opened only for consultation, and if the lot has already received proposals from Suppliers.

### How to view the proposals made?

You can click on the View proposals button. A list with all the proposals will be displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you click on the "Proposal List" button, available only for "Global Price" type bidding, you have access to all the proposals received in that bidding.

When the bidding process is still open, there are no actions available for the Revisor. When the bidding process is closed, the status changes to "In analysis" and the Association chooses one of the proposals. Once the choice is made, the Revisor will receive a notification.&#x20;

After that, the Revisor must access the bidding page again. This time, the System will show which proposal is the best (lowest value) and which one was chosen by the Association.
