# Administrator Profiles

## Types of Administrator Profiles

There are three possible types of administrator profiles with differing permissions. These are the three types of profiles:

* **General Administrator**: has unrestricted access to system information and permission to perform all possible actions within it.
* **Reviewer Administrator**: has access only to the bids and contracts belonging to the agreements designated for them by the General Administrator. Within these agreements, they can perform all necessary actions for bidding and contract workflows.
* **Viewer Administrator**: has unrestricted access to system information, but cannot execute any actions.

The System interface is the same for all three profiles and only a few points have differences between the workflows and actions that each can perform, this manual presents compatible explanations for the needs of all Administrator Profiles. In those points where the permissions of the General Administrator and the Reviewer Administrator diverge, the differences between them will be properly explained.
