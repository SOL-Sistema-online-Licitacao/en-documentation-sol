For each tender displayed, we have access to the last ten open tenders and can view key information about the documents. Are they:

* The title of the tender;
* The situation in which it finds itself (status);
* Period of time it will remain open.

To view all bids in addition to the latest bids, simply click the Browse bids button.

#### Review of the bidding

After creating the bid, the status changes to “Awaiting release”, as shown in the image below. Then, the Reviewer of the Agreement will check if the data entered in the bidding are correct, as well as the information on lots and items.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Released Tender

If all bid data are correct, the Reviewer will release it. At that moment, the bidding status will be “Released”. The Association profile will receive a notification when the status change occurs.&#x20;

When the bid is released, its public notice is available for viewing and download. To access it, just click on the "Download public notice" button available on the same screen shown above.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Open bidding

As soon as the bidding start date, defined by the Association at the time of its creation, arrives, the bidding will change to the “Open” status. Only from the “Start date”, suppliers will be able to send proposals for the bidding.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Rejected Bid

If any bidding information needs to be corrected, the Reviewer of the agreement will refuse it. Whenever this occurs, he must specify the reason for the refusal. The status of the bidding automatically returns to "In Draft" and a message is displayed to the Association.
{% endhint %}

The Association will always be notified about changes in the situation of the tenders created. Changes are displayed in the “Notifications” tab, accessed from the main menu.
