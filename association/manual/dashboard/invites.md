# Invites

### How to send invitations?

The process for sending invitations to suppliers is the same, regardless of the chosen bidding method. However, if an invitation is sent when the bidding is already "Open", the invited Supplier will not receive notification. Just click on Invitations to manage them.&#x20;

Just click Manage Invitations to start the process. The first screen to be displayed will be the “List of suppliers”. In it, it is necessary to click on Add supplier so that a new page with the list is displayed.&#x20;

On the "Available suppliers" page, all suppliers registered with SOL will be displayed. When you find the supplier you want to send the invitation to, click on its name. Then, the system will add the Supplier to the list of suppliers.&#x20;

If it is necessary to invite new suppliers, just repeat the process and, at the end, click on Save invitations. In this way, the chosen suppliers will be notified when the bidding is opened for the submission of proposals.
