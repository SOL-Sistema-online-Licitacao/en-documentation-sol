# Proposals reviews

The proposal review step involves both the Association and the Reviewer. In it, the Association must analyze the proposals received and accept the one that best meets its needs – the lowest value proposal is always indicated by the system as "Best proposal". Once this is done, the Reviewer is called upon to review the Association's decision.

### Accept the best offer

If there is no conflict of interest or any other type of problem between the Association and the Supplier that sent the best proposal, just click on Accept. A new screen is displayed to confirm this acceptance. In it, just click on Accept proposal again. This done, a new page is displayed and the Reviewer will be notified to evaluate the Association's decision.

### Decline the best offer

If the Association has any reason to refuse the best proposal, indicated by the System – such as a conflict of interest with the Supplier – it must click Decline on the “List of Proposals” screen and then fill in the field “Describe the reason for refusal” . Once this is done, just click on Decline proposal. The Reviewer will be notified and will review the Association's refusal, and may or may not accept it.

### A draw

If two or more suppliers send proposals with exactly the same values, the System will trigger them to update the values within the period stipulated by the Association at the time of creation of the bid. During this period, the bidding status will be "Awaiting Tiebreaker". After this period, the system will normally analyze proposals and indicate which option is the best. If the new proposals have the same value again, the System itself will perform the tiebreaker using a time criterion - the proposal sent and/or updated first will be considered the best.

### deserted bid

If the period defined for a bid ends without it receiving any proposal, its status is changed to "Deserted". With this, the system automatically generates a new bid in the "In draft" situation, with the same name (object), same data and specifications. If necessary, the Association may edit this bid and resubmit it for review.
