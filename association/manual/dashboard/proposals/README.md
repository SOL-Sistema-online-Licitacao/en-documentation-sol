# Proposals

A bid can start receiving proposals from suppliers as soon as its status is updated to "Open", which happens automatically when the start date stipulated by the Association when creating the bid arrives.

Proposals can be sent at any time during the period in which the bidding is open and what defines whether any supplier can apply or if only invited suppliers will have this possibility is the bidding modality, which can be “Open”, “Invitation open” or “Closed invitation”, and which is chosen by the Association itself.

During the period in which the bidding is open, the Association can only view the values of the proposals received as long as their modality is "Closed Invitation", but no action or information about the suppliers is available.

In "Open/Public" or "Open Invitation" modality bids, it is not possible to view the proposals before their closing.

When the deadline for closing the bidding is reached, the Association will be able to access the proposals received. The System automatically indicates which one is the best, that is, which one is the lowest cost. Still, the Association is free to choose a different bid if there is any conflict of interest, for example with respect to the lowest bid. In this case, it is necessary to justify the choice, and it is up to the Reviewer to accept or reject the justification. When the bidding is closed, the status is updated to "Under review".
