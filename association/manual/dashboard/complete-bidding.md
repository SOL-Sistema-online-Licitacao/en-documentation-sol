# Complete bidding

### How to complete a bid?

After choosing the proposal that best meets your needs, and having the Reviewer approve the decision, the Association will receive a notification. So, just click on the notification to open the proposal screen and, in it, click on the Tender tab.

On this screen, just click on Complete Bid. The bidding status is changed to "Completed" and the System automatically generates a contract from it.

### How to complete a Failed Bid?

If the Association rejects all bids received, and the Agreement Reviewer approves these refusals, the Association must cancel the bid or conclude it as a failure.

To do so, select the bid and click on Finish failed bid, describe the reason for the failure on the page that will open and click on Finish bid.
