### How to update the status of a contract?

{% hint style="info" %}
In the case of a contract with the “Signed” status, you also have the option to download the contract in PDF format, just click on the “Download original contract” button. For this type of contract, it is also possible to update it to “Completed”, “Partially executed” or “Complete non-performance”, depending on whether the contract is fulfilled by the Supplier.
{% endhint %}

To update the contract status, you must click on the Update contract button. Then, define what situation the contract is in.

After changing, you can click the Save button. Then the status of the contract will be updated.

### Set as Completed

The contract must be defined as “Concluded” when its execution has been fully honored and the bidding project has been met. When defining the situation as completed, a success notice will open on the screen.

### Set to Partially Done

The contract shall be defined as "Partially Performed" when its performance was only partially honored by the supplier – ie - contracted items or services were not delivered or performed in full.

If this description applies to your case, select the "Partially executed" option and click Next.

At this moment, a screen will be displayed with the contracted items and a field for the Association to indicate how many units of the items were delivered. Then just click Save.

This process is what ensures that undelivered items become available again in the agreement so that the Association creates a new bid, if necessary, to acquire them.

### Set as Total Non-Execution

The status of the contract must be defined as "Total non-performance" when its performance is not honored by the supplier - that is - when none of the contracted products or services are delivered or carried out.&#x20;

If this description applies to the contract in question, the Association must select the option "Total non-performance" in the field "Define the new situation of the contract". When doing so, the System will give you two options as a next step:

* Create a new bid with these items: if the Association selects this option, the System will generate a new bid in Draft format with items 14 referring to this contract;
* Choose a new proposal: if the Association selects this option, the status of the contract will be updated to "Total non-performance" and the bidding for it will be reopened.

Com isso, o Sistema disponibiliza novamente as propostas recebidas na licitação para que seja escolhido um novo vencedor.
