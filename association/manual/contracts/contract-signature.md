# Contract signature

A contract is automatically generated by the system whenever a Supplier's proposal for a given bid is accepted by both the Association and the Reviewer responsible for that agreement. After this acceptance, the Association must click on Complete bidding for the contract to be generated. After its creation, the new contract appears in the “Contracts” tab with the status “Awaiting supplier”.

{% hint style="info" %}
By clicking Finish bidding, the Association is already automatically signing the contract. At that time, the Reviewer and the chosen Provider will receive notification that the agreement has been created. At this stage, the Supplier can accept the contract – and automatically sign it – or it can refuse the contract.
{% endhint %}

If the Supplier accepts and automatically signs the contract, the Association will be notified and the contract status will be updated to "Signed".

{% hint style="danger" %}
### Contract rejected by supplier

When the Association completes the bid and the contract is generated, the chosen Supplier receives a notification. At this stage, the contract can be declined by this user. This can happen, for example, if the bidding is open for a long time and, at the time the contract is generated, the supplier no longer has the bid items. In this case, the Association will receive a notification and the status of the contract will be updated on the "Contracts" page to "Declined".
